          <p>The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones.[1][failed verification] A musician who plays
         the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.  </p>
          <p>Flutes are the earliest extant musical instruments, as paleolithic instruments with hand-bored holes have been found. A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany.
           These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.</p>
